# Linked-list
A simple linked list written in C for rookies.
Just some basic linked list stuffs, without any optimaizations.
Compiled and linked with MVS 2013.
Data types were wrapped as LinkedList (representing the linked list), Node (representing the node of the linked list, containing pointers of previous node, next node and data value), Iterator (representing the pointer to the nodes). 
Right now this shabby library allows appending, inserting, removing elements from the specific linked list.
Further plan is to utilize deque, stack base on this linked list library.
